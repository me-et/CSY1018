    My name is Meet and I was born in London and have grown up there for the most part of my life. My interest in computers came about at a very early age and have been keen on exploring and learning how they work.
    With that being said, the decision to go to uni and study for a degree in Software Engineering was an easy choice for me as I had not lost interest and was just as keen.<br><br>

    When I was in Secondary School and Sixth Form, my favourite subjects were Maths and Science, as unfortunately we did not have a Computing-related subject at the time (compared to now, where it's been introduced in most schools across the country).
    Usually much of my spare time goes into drawing, reading and gaming. I also do a bit of design work utilising Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to create logos for clients.
