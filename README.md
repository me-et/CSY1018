When taking on this assignment a few weeks ago, the website was incomplete but I was attempting to push the files to GitHub,
in the process I ended up losing more than half of the work I updated because my Computer blue screened (crashed, as pictured
on the left, taken at the time of the crash. If the image is not available, it can be accessed here: http://i.imgur.com/dallMXd.jpg).
Due to this I was pretty demotivated to do it all over again as I spent around 4 hours on it and over half of it had just disappeared 
because I didn’t keep saving at every point. 

I resumed working on my website again just around a week and a half ago and as much as it was frustrating due to losing my work previously,
I found it pretty easy to catch up although time consuming. I had several problems with the use of divs (dividers) and flexbox, as at times 
I wasn’t able to get the columns the sizes I wanted them to be. I worked around this by using https://demo.agektmr.com/flexbox/.

It helped me a great deal as I was finally able to grasp how to weight the columns to the way I wanted them, as this related to the layout
of all the content that was going to be added in the future. Another issue I had was positioning elements correctly, as the colours included
in the columns were contrasting and I was trying to position the elements correctly so that they didn’t look like they were all out of place.
Although this was frustrating too, I went through a process of trial and error to get the elements in their correct positions, though once I
was able to get them into their correct positions I had a much easier time with all the other pages that had to be produced.

Designing the website itself was probably the most frustrating thing, as I had not thought it out before starting initially weeks ago, I had
to do a lot of work to get it to look somewhat decent, the design as it stands is pretty simple but easy on the eyes and I feel as if I did
use the material approach correctly.
