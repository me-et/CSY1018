      I was working as a Retail Assistant at PRIMARK based in Bromley on a Christmas placement
      that I applied for. I was working at the till mainly and whenever it
      was not busy I would be on the shop floor doing jobs that were needed
      to be done at the time or helping others.<br><br>

      <b>Company: Euro Car Parts Ltd.<br></b>
      (Year 11)<br>
      Experience: I had to update the data in a spreadsheet and create whole new ones, I also required to do manual work such as going into the store room and counting the quantity of items in stock, assisted other employees in their work which included travelling to other branches of Eurocar parts. Receiving and checking,
      and recording as well as stock checking was a part of my job too.<br><br>

      (Year 12)<br>
      Experience: I was helping with deliveries every morning, making sure all the shelves are organised and tidy.

      Organising the stock room was also one of many similar jobs I was allocated when working at Boots.
